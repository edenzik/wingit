Consider budget travelers. They are characterized by their flexbility on:
- Specific departure date
- Duration of stay
- Number of connections
- Airline
- Departure airport around their location
- Time of departure during the day

Their primary motivation when booking a flight is finding the cheapest way to get to their destination. Even still, the experience of buying a flight for a budget traveler is filled with inconvinences and anxieties. Many comperison tools exists (Kayak, Google Flights, HipMunk and others) with the purpose of finding you the cheapest flight on a specific date, but travelers often find themselves hopping between services and even waiting to book their iteniraries until prices go down. In some ways, many travelers have to dabble in speculation on the prices of flights - aided by tools such as Kayak and Google flights which predict if prices will go up or down.

Overall, the process of finding a budget flight is:
- Decide on a specific range of dates and a destination
- Check several flight search websites to find flights within your criteria
- Decide a flight is too expensive, and check back later - espically if the search engine they are using is telling them to "wait". Repeat until you find a flight within budget or pay a lot more if the price happens to go strictly up.

Imagine a service that is not a search engine for flights, but rather a travel agent that will allow travelers to pay for a "generic flight" that fits their criteria. This flight will be competitively priced, such that:
- It is ALWAYS cheaper than any flight they could have booked at the day of booking (saving them having to check multiple sites)
- It is sold at a small premium over the flight they could have gotten had they booked it at the cheapest time (mostly saving them having to go back and check)

Instead, they will pay upfront to WingIt for a "generic flight" on a specific day. The price they will be quoted will be cheaper than anything they would see on other websites (guranteed by WingIt). Once they bought their ticket, the system will start looking for the actual cheapest time to buy said ticket. Given:

- A good model that can predict cheapest flight on a specific date
- The passanger's information (passport, DOB, etc.).

For example:
- A passanger wants to book a flight to London on
